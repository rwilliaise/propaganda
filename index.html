                <p>Modern governments, corporations, and political parties
                actively exploit the tool of propaganda to influence the masses
                every day. This has been true for as long as structured
                civilization has existed. It only becomes more prevalent as
                modes of communication become more accessible. The US is no
                different.</p>
                <p>When the U.S. government enters a war, it must continually
                justify to its citizenry that the war is justified and that
                resources should still be put into it. In World War I, the
                United States sent its propaganda machines into
                <em>overdrive</em>. This continued into World War II, and then
                the Cold War.</p>

                <h2>1918.</h2>
                <p>The American Red Cross recruited over one third of the
                United States population as donors or volunteers. This American
                Red Cross poster shows how this was achieved -- notice the usage
                of Miss Columbia, the personification of the U.S itself,
                solemnly looking for aid, the striking Red Cross of the
                background. The text is more of a two-sentence poem instead of a
                memorable slogan.</p>

                <p class="spaced">Much of the propaganda was about funding the
                war -- to be fair, those seeing it probably were not the ones
                fit to fight. Notice that the text is rather poetic. The framing
                focuses on the soldier, and glorifies his fight. It does not
                show him injured or hurt. </p>

                <p>Notice the usage of emotional appeals in this poster:
                it frames the viewer's inaction as hurting a soldier on the
                field. The usage of large, geometric lettering for "BUY WAR
                BONDS" makes it the forefront of the image, and the first thing
                that the viewer looks at.</p>

                <p class="spaced">However, perhaps the most effective method of messaging is
                this nebulous idea of freedom. Remember that freedom is
                inapplicable to anything other than the individual. In other
                words, by saying "For Freedom's Sake" it directly pins it onto
                the listener, i.e. "For Your Freedom's Sake." That is why it is
                such an effective rhetorical strategy: it's a one word emotional
                appeal.</p>

                <h2>1951.</h2>
                <p>After World War II, the U.S entered a rivalry against
                the Soviet Union. It was decided that the only way to prevent
                the spread and domination of Soviet influence was the policy of
                "containment." This meant funding and aiding independence
                movements in countries that had communist governments or
                stomping out communist insurgents. This poster is propaganda
                against the communist forces in Korea. This marked a shift into
                propaganda being more integrated into mass media, especially
                under the direction of the CIA overseas.</p>

                <p>During the Korean War, Filipino soldiers were sent to fight
                in Korea for the United Nations in the Philippine Expeditionary
                Force to Korea (PEFTOK). Forces were convinced through posters
                such as this one.</p>

                <p>The most egregious violation of human rights through American
                propaganda has to be the COINTELPRO collection of illegal
                projects by the FBI. One of these included the infamous MLK
                suicide letter, which was also preceded by a smear campaign
                against King.</p>

                <p>The FBI also sowed seeds of discord into the ranks of
                Malcolm X as well as others associated in the past with the
                Nation of Islam. This eventually led to Malcolm X being hunted
                and having to defend himself "by any means necessary," as shown
                in this image.</p>
