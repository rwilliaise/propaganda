                <p>Modern governments, corporations, and political parties
                actively exploit the tool of propaganda to influence the masses
                every day. This has been true for as long as structured
                civilization has existed. It only becomes more prevalent as
                modes of communication become more accessible. The US is no
                different.</p>
                <p>When the U.S. government enters a war, it must continually
                justify to its citizenry that the war is justified and that
                resources should still be put into it. In World War I, the
                United States sent its propaganda machines into
                <em>overdrive</em>. This continued into World War II, and then
                the Cold War.</p>

                <p>1918 - The American Red Cross recruited over one third of the
                United States population as donors or volunteers. This American
                Red Cross poster shows how this was achieved -- notice the usage
                of Miss Columbia, the personification of the U.S itself,
                solemnly looking for aid, the striking Red Cross of the
                background. The text is more of a two-sentence poem instead of a
                memorable slogan.</p>

                <p>1918 - Much of the propaganda was about funding the war --
                to be fair, those seeing it probably were not the ones fit to
                fight. Notice that the text is rather poetic. The framing

                <p>1943 - Notice the usage of emotional appeals in this poster:
                it frames the viewer's inaction as hurting a soldier on the
                field. The usage of large, geometric lettering for "BUY WAR
                BONDS" makes it the forefront of the image, and the first thing
                that the viewer looks at.</p>

                <p>1943 - However, perhaps the most effective method of messaging is
                this nebulous idea of freedom. Remember that freedom is
                inapplicable to anything other than the individual. In other
                words, by saying "For Freedom's Sake" it directly pins it onto
                the listener, i.e. "For Your Freedom's Sake." That is why it is
                such an effective rhetorical strategy: it's a one word emotional
                appeal.</p>
